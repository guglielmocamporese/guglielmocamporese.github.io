    <h1>Computing the Probability of Catching a Mosquito by Hands</h1>

Let's consider that you are resting in bed trying to falling asleep, and suddenly a mosquito comes in to play. What is the chance that you are going to catch the mosquito with your hands? Let's trying to answer this question by modeling this situation!

<br><br>

<div class="header-frame">
  <img id="propic" src="{{ base_dir }}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/body.png') }}" alt="" />
</div>

<br>

The involved variables are:

<ul>
	<li>the velocity of the mosquito $v_m$,</li>
	<li>the velocity of the arm $v_a$,</li>
	<li>the lenght of your arm $l_a$,</li>
	<li>the distance between your ear and its relative shoulder $d_{es}$.</li>
</ul>

In this scenario, we assume that the mosquito is exactly in the position of the ear $e.$

When you decide to move the arm in order to catch the mosquito, instantaneously, the mosquito starts to fly away. In this setting, after an interval of $\nabla t$ seconds, the mosquito is close to the ear in the half-sphere of radius $d_m$.

<br><br>

<div class="header-frame">
  <img id="propic" src="{{ base_dir }}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/mosquito.png') }}" alt="" />
</div>

<br>

Considering the max speed of the mosquito $v_m$ traveled in a straight line, the radius of the half-sphere $H\text{-}S$ can be computed as follows:

$$d_m = v_m \cdot \nabla t \ [m]$$

where the interval $\nabla t$ is the amount of time required for the arm to reach the ear (assuming a linear trajectory of the hand):

$$\nabla t = \frac{d_{es}  + l_a}{v_a} \ [s].$$

Assuming a uniform spatial distribution of the mosquito in the sphere region, the probability $P_{catch}$ of catching it in a region ball of radius $h$ (this region coincides with your closed hand once you try to catch the mosquito) is: 

$$
\begin{split}
P_{catch} &= \int_{H\text{-}S} 1 \cdot dx dy dz \\
&= \int_0^h \int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi \frac{2}{\frac{4}{3}\pi d_m^3} r^2 sin\phi \ d\theta \ d\phi \ dr \\
&= \left( \frac{v_a}{v_m} \frac{h}{d_{es} + l_a} \right)^3
\end{split}
$$

Now it's time to get some numbers. Searching online I found that: 

<ul>
	<li>the velocity of an average mosquito is $v_m = 0.56 \pm 0.1 \left[ \frac{m}{s} \right]$,</li>
	<li><strong>[1]</strong> the velocity of a young man arm is $v_a = 2.5 \left[ \frac{m}{s} \right]$,</li>
	<li>the average length of an arm is $l_a = 0.6 \ [m]$</li>
	<li>the distance between the ear and the shoulder is $d_{es} = 0.2 \ [m]$,</li>
	<li>the radius of a closed hand is $h = 0.04 \ [m]$.</li>
</ul>

Using such number values we get the probability of catching the mosquito in your ear is:

$$P_{catch} = \left( \frac{2.5}{0.56} \frac{0.04}{0.6 + 0.2} \right)^3 \approx 1.11\%$$

The mosquito will probably fly away :)
